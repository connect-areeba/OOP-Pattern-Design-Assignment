Abstract Base Class: Server

Attributes:
String ipAddress: The unique identifier.
Location coordinates: Physical GPS or region data.
Status health: (Online, Offline, High Load).

Methods:
receiveRequest(Request r): Initial entry point for traffic.
sendResponse(Data d): Packages and sends data back.

Sub-Class: EdgeServer (Inherits from Server)

Unique Attributes:
Map<String, Content> localCache: A key-value store of cached files.
int maxStorage: The capacity limit for caching.
int currentLoad: Tracks how many users are currently connected.

Unique Methods:
checkCache(String contentID): Boolean check to see if content exists locally.
fetchFromOrigin(OriginServer o): Triggered on a "Cache Miss."
purgeCache(String contentID): Removes stale data.

Sub-Class: OriginServer (Inherits from Server)

Unique Attributes:
Database masterStorage: The permanent home of all assets.
List<EdgeServer> subscribers: A list of edge servers to notify of updates.

Unique Methods:
provideMasterCopy(String contentID): Serves the definitive version of a file.
notifySubscribers(): Used in the Observer Pattern to tell edge servers to update.

2. Supporting Classes & Objects
The Content Object
This represents the actual file being delivered (an image, video, or script).
Attributes:
String id: The URL/Name.
Binary data: The actual bits.
DateTime ttl (Time To Live): The expiration date of the cache.
int version: To track updates.
The RequestRouter (The Controller/Facade)
This isn't a server, but the "brain" that directs the user.
Attributes:
List<EdgeServer> networkMap: A registry of all available nodes.
Methods:
findNearestNode(UserLocation u): Uses the Strategy Pattern to find the best EdgeServer object.

3. The Interaction Flow (The Object "Conversation")
Here is how these objects interact when a User tries to load a photo:
Selection: The User object sends a request to the RequestRouter.
Polymorphism in Action: The RequestRouter calls findNearestNode(). It looks at its networkMap and selects a specific instance of an EdgeServer (e.g., London_Node_01).
The Request: The User calls London_Node_01.receiveRequest(photo_request).
Encapsulation & Logic:
The EdgeServer runs checkCache().
Scenario A (Cache Hit): It immediately calls sendResponse() using its own localCache.
Scenario B (Cache Miss): The EdgeServer object "talks" to the OriginServer object using fetchFromOrigin().
Update: The OriginServer calls provideMasterCopy(). The EdgeServer stores this in its localCache attribute for the next user and then finishes by calling sendResponse().
